# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-XGBoost

## Description

This project predicts the type of Breast Cancer i.e. Malignant or Benign based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (Diagnostic) taken from the UCI Repository. In this project we have used two models namely XGBoost and Random Forest Classifier for the classification. We have compared the accuracies of both the model and analyze which model gives better results.
